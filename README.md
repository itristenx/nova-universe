---

[â†’ Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart.md)

## Repository Structure

- **nova-api** â€“ Nova Platform API (Express/PostgreSQL backend)
- **nova-core** â€“ Nova Core (React admin interface with integrated kiosk activation management)
- **nova-beacon** â€“ Nova Beacon (iPad kiosk for ticket submission)
- **nova-comms** â€“ Nova Comms (Slack slash command integration)

The `design/theme.js` file defines shared colors, fonts and spacing. Frontends import these tokens so styles remain consistent across the admin UI and kiosk app.

## Setup

Run `./scripts/setup.sh` to install Node.js.
Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and adjust any values for your machine.
`setup.sh` creates missing `.env` files automatically. You can rerun `./scripts/init-env.sh` to regenerate them.
You can also follow the manual instructions below.
See [Local vs Production Setup](docs/environments.md) for details on configuring the environment variables used by each service.

### Platform API
1. Navigate to `nova-api`.
2. Dependencies should already be installed from the repository root with `pnpm install`.
3. Edit the `.env` file with your SMTP configuration and `HELPDESK_EMAIL`.
   To send tickets directly to HelpScout instead, provide
   `HELPSCOUT_API_KEY` and `HELPSCOUT_MAILBOX_ID` (optionally set
   `HELPSCOUT_SMTP_FALLBACK=true` to also send email).
   **Note:** ServiceNow integration has been fully deprecated and removed.
   You can customize `API_PORT`, `LOGO_URL`, `FAVICON_URL` and `ORGANIZATION_NAME`.
4. Start the server with `node index.js` (uses `API_PORT`, default `3000`).

The API also exposes a GraphQL endpoint at `/api/v2/graphql` for internal tools.
Authenticate with an admin JWT token before making requests. You can explore it with Apollo Sandbox or `curl`:

```graphql
query {
  tickets {
    id
    title
    priority
  }
}
```

### Core Admin UI
1. Navigate to `nova-core`.
2. Dependencies should already be installed from the repository root with `pnpm install`.
3. Edit the `.env` file and set `VITE_API_URL`. You can also set `VITE_LOGO_URL`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5173`.

The admin interface includes comprehensive kiosk management functionality, including:
- Kiosk activation via QR codes or manual entry
- System configuration management for ticket categories
- Server management and restart capabilities
- User management with role-based access control
- Integrated security features with rate limiting and input validation

The backend stores ticket logs in a local PostgreSQL database.
Configuration values are stored in the same database and can be edited from the admin UI.

### Comms (Slack Service)
1. Create a Slack app following [Slack's app setup guide](https://api.slack.com/apps) and add a `/new-ticket` slash command (see [Slash commands documentation](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands)). Set its request URL to this service.
2. Navigate to `nova-comms` (dependencies were installed from the repository root with `pnpm install`).
3. Edit the `.env` file and set:
   - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
   - `API_URL`
   - optional `SLACK_PORT` (defaults to `3001`)
4. Start the service with `node index.js`. It listens on `SLACK_PORT`.
5. For local testing expose the port with `ngrok` and use the HTTPS URL in your Slack command:

```bash
npx ngrok http $SLACK_PORT
```

### HTTPS Setup

1. Generate a self-signed certificate:

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
   ```

2. Set `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` in `nova-api/.env` to the certificate paths.
3. Update the URLs in all `.env` files to use `https://localhost` as shown in the examples.
4. Place `cert.pem` and `key.pem` in the project root before running the installer scripts so the files are bundled.

### Running All Services

Scripts are provided to launch the API, admin UI, and Slack
service together using `concurrently`. When running the script you will be
prompted to choose which apps to start (press **Enter** for all). For each
selected app the script verifies that a `.env` file exists and installs
dependencies if the `node_modules` directory is missing. Each service is
started with `npm start` so its environment file loads correctly.

```powershell
./scripts/start-all.ps1
```

### Windows Installer

Install [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) along with Node.js and npm.
Run the following command to generate `Nova-<version>.exe`:

```powershell
./tools/scripts/scripts/make-windows-installer.ps1 -Version 1.0.0
```

Run the generated `.exe` to install Nova Universe.

### Linux Installer

Install `electron-installer-appimage` globally with:

```bash
npm install -g electron-installer-appimage
```

Then build the AppImage:

```bash
./tools/scripts/scripts/make-linux-installer.sh 1.0.0
```

Mark the output file executable and run it to start the application.

All installer and upgrade scripts live in `tools/scripts/scripts/` and should include basic tests to verify they work.

## Running Tests

Nova Universe includes automated test suites for the backend API and the admin UI.

### nova-api

Run from the repository root:
1. `pnpm --filter nova-universe-api test`

The API tests are written with Mocha and exercise the main Express endpoints.

### nova-core

Run from the repository root:
1. `pnpm --filter nova-core-admin test`

This suite uses Jest and React Testing Library to validate the UI.

See the [contributor guide](docs/development.md) for additional details.
When adding JavaScript tests for installer scripts be sure to run `npm run lint` in the package you updated.

## Testing the API

To manually submit a ticket you can use `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/submit-ticket \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "[CUSTOMER NAME]",
    "email": "example@example.com",
    "title": "IT Tester Account",
    "system": "[NAME OF SYSTEM]",
    "urgency": "[Urgent, High, Medium, Low]",
    "description": "This is an example of a description"
}'
```

For a complete description of all endpoints see
[nova-api/README.md](nova-api/README.md#api-endpoints).

## HelpScout Integration #PENDING CHANGE TO IMPORT ONLY TO NOVA

When `HELPSCOUT_API_KEY` and `HELPSCOUT_MAILBOX_ID` are defined in
`nova-api/.env`, the API creates a new HelpScout conversation for each ticket
submitted to `POST /submit-ticket`. Set `HELPSCOUT_SMTP_FALLBACK=true` if you
want the server to also send the ticket email using your SMTP configuration.

## ServiceNow Integration (Deprecated)

ServiceNow support has been **removed** from the platform and no
ServiceNow-specific configuration or endpoints remain.

## Kiosk Activation

When the Nova Beacon application launches it sends a `POST` request to
`/api/register-kiosk` with a unique identifier. The backend stores the kiosk in
the `kiosks` table with `active` set to `0` (inactive). A kiosk cannot submit
tickets until it is activated.

An administrator can toggle the `active` flag from the **Kiosks** tab in the
admin UI or directly from the Beacon kiosk. The admin interface calls
`PUT /api/kiosks/:id/active` to update the flag. When a kiosk is inactive the
app displays an activation screen showing the API URL and kiosk ID. Tapping the
**Activate** button sends the request to enable the kiosk.

To remotely disable a kiosk open the **Kiosks** tab in the admin UI and toggle
the active switch to the off position. You can also send a `PUT` request to
`/api/kiosks/{id}/active` with `{ "active": false }` to deactivate a kiosk via
the API. The kiosk will stop displaying the ticket form once its next activation
check detects the change.

## Environment Variables

Each app relies on a few environment variables:

### Platform API

- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS` â€“ SMTP credentials used by
  Nodemailer.
- `HELPSCOUT_API_KEY`, `HELPSCOUT_MAILBOX_ID` â€“ enable HelpScout integration
  for ticket submissions.
- `HELPSCOUT_SMTP_FALLBACK` â€“ set to `true` to also send email via SMTP.
- `SESSION_SECRET`, `SAML_ENTRY_POINT`, `SAML_ISSUER`, `SAML_CERT`,
  `SAML_CALLBACK_URL`, `ADMIN_URL` â€“ required for SAML login.
 - Optional: `API_PORT` (default `3000`), `LOGO_URL`, `FAVICON_URL`, `ORGANIZATION_NAME`.
- Optional: set `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` to enable HTTPS.

  password management endpoints.
- `JWT_SECRET` â€“ secret used to sign JSON Web Tokens.
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` â€“ token expiration (e.g., `1h`).
- `SCIM_TOKEN` â€“ bearer token required for SCIM provisioning endpoints.

- `DISABLE_AUTH` â€“ set to `true` to bypass SAML authentication and
  access the admin UI before SSO is configured.

### Core Admin UI

- `VITE_API_URL` â€“ base URL of the backend API.
- `VITE_LOGO_URL` â€“ default logo shown before configuration is loaded.
- `VITE_FAVICON_URL` â€“ default favicon for the page.

### Comms (Slack Service)
