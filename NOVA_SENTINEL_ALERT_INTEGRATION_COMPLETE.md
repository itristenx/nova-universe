# 🌟 Nova Sentinel + Alert System Integration - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

The Nova Sentinel monitoring system has been seamlessly integrated with the Nova Alert System to create a comprehensive, intelligent monitoring and alerting solution. This integration leverages **Cosmo AI** for intelligent alert analysis, **Nova Helix** for authentication, and the **Nova API** for ticket creation, providing end-to-end monitoring with automatic incident response.

## ✅ **Complete Integration Features**

### 🔮 **AI-Powered Intelligence**
- **Cosmo Analysis**: Every monitor failure is analyzed by Cosmo AI for intelligent alert recommendations
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: AI considers monitor type, VIP status, customer tier, and business impact
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-1 confidence levels for all automated decisions
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-generated next steps and resolution guidance

### 🛠 **Technical Integration Points**

#### **1. Monitor Failure → Intelligent Processing**
```javascript
Monitor Down → Cosmo AI Analysis → {
  High Confidence (>0.8) → Create Alert + Ticket + Notifications
  Medium Confidence (0.5-0.8) → Create Ticket Only
  Low Confidence (<0.5) → Log Only
}
```

#### **2. Auto-Recovery Detection**
```javascript
Monitor Recovery → {
  Resolve Active Incident
  Close Associated Ticket
  Resolve Alert
  Send Recovery Notifications
}
```

#### **3. Cross-System Correlation**
```javascript
Incident Creation → {
  Store in monitoring_incidents table
  Link to tickets.id if ticket created  
  Link to alert_id if alert triggered
  Track correlation for unified dashboards
}
```

## 🤖 **Cosmo AI Integration**

### **Enhanced Analysis Engine**
```javascript
// Advanced monitor analysis with business context
const analysis = await analyzeAlertSituation({
  monitorId: 'srv-001',
  monitorName: 'Production API',
  monitorType: 'http',
  status: 'down',
  errorMessage: 'Connection timeout',
  serviceCategory: 'infrastructure',
  keywords: ['api', 'production', 'outage'],
  customerTier: 'vip',
  affectedUsers: 500,
  tenantId: 'acme-corp'
}, 'Production API is down with connection timeout. Should we alert?', 'system');

// Returns intelligent recommendation:
{
  action: 'create_alert',           // create_alert, escalate_alert, suggest_resolution, no_action
  confidence: 0.92,                // 0-1 confidence score
  reasoning: 'High-impact production service with VIP customers affected...',
  suggestions: [
    'Check load balancer health',
    'Verify database connectivity', 
    'Review recent deployments'
  ],
  alertData: { ... },              // Recommended alert configuration
  escalationData: { ... }          // Escalation recommendations
}
```

### **Business Rule Integration**
- **VIP Customer Protection**: Higher alert thresholds for VIP-affecting services
- **Time-Based Logic**: Different rules for business hours vs off-hours
- **Service Criticality**: Production services get immediate alerts
- **Impact Assessment**: User count and customer tier influence decisions

- **Role-Based Access**: 
  - `monitoring:read` - View monitors and incidents
  - `monitoring:create` - Create new monitors
  - `monitoring:incident:create` - Create incidents manually
  - `monitoring:incident:resolve` - Resolve incidents
- **Tenant Isolation**: Users only see their organization's monitors
- **Audit Logging**: All operations logged to `monitoring_audit_log`

### **API Security**

- **Notification Delivery**: Success rates for Slack, email, webhooks

## 🎛 **Configuration & Deployment**

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Uptime Kuma Integration
UPTIME_KUMA_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001
UPTIME_KUMA_API_KEY=your-kuma-api-key
UPTIME_KUMA_ENABLED=true

# Alert System Integration  
SYSTEM_API_TOKEN=your-system-token
ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret

# Monitoring Thresholds
TICKET_VOLUME_THRESHOLD=50
RESPONSE_TIME_THRESHOLD=1000
VIP_QUEUE_THRESHOLD=5
```

### **Database Migration**
```bash
# Run the enhanced alert system migration
psql -d nova_universe -f apps/api/migrations/postgresql/20250809120000_nova_alert_system.sql
```

## 🔄 **Workflow Examples**

### **1. Critical Service Outage**
```
1. Uptime Kuma detects API failure
2. Webhook sent to /api/v2/monitoring/events
3. Nova processes event → calls Cosmo AI analysis
4. Cosmo: "Critical production API, 500 users affected, VIP customers"
5. Auto-creates: High-priority ticket + Critical alert + Notifications
6. Pulse technician gets alert, sees correlated ticket and monitoring data
7. Service recovers → Auto-resolves incident, ticket, and alert
```

### **2. Minor Service Degradation**
```
1. Monitor detects slow response times
2. Cosmo analysis: "Non-critical service, low user impact"
3. Creates ticket for investigation, no immediate alert
4. Logged in monitoring dashboard for review
5. Technician can manually escalate if needed
```

### **3. Scheduled Maintenance**
```
1. Admin creates maintenance window in Nova Core
2. Affected monitors automatically suppressed during window
3. Orbit status page shows maintenance banner
4. Users notified via subscriptions
5. Monitoring resumes after maintenance window
```
