# Legacy Core Application Cleanup Action Plan

## üéØ Objective
Remove the Nova Core legacy application while preserving essential data and ensuring zero downtime.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Cleanup Verification Complete

### Migration Status: 100% VERIFIED ‚úÖ
- **Unified Application**: Successfully running and functional
- **All Features Migrated**: EmailAccountsPage, NotificationsPage, and all other core functionality
- **No Dependencies**: Zero code dependencies between unified and core applications
- **Navigation Complete**: All features accessible via unified interface
- **Testing Complete**: Application starts successfully and all routes functional

---

## üöÄ Cleanup Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Safe to Execute Now)

#### 1.1 Remove Core Application from Production Deployment
```bash
# Edit docker-compose.prod.yml to remove/comment out nova-core service
```
**Files to Modify:**
- `/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Remove or comment out nova-core service block (lines 90-96)

**Expected Impact**: None - core application no longer needed

#### 1.2 Update Environment Configuration
```bash
# Remove CORE_URL from production environment
```
**Environment Variables to Remove:**
- `CORE_URL=https://admin.your-domain.com` (from .env.production.template)

**Environment Variables to KEEP:**
- `CORE_DATABASE_URL` - Still needed for data access
- `CORE_DB_*` variables - Database connection still required

#### 1.3 Archive Core Application Code
```bash
# Create backup of core application
mkdir -p backups/legacy-applications/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mv apps/core backups/legacy-applications/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/nova-core-legacy
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Updates

#### 2.1 Update Reverse Proxy/Load Balancer
- Remove routes pointing to legacy core application (port 3000)
- Redirect all admin URLs to unified application (port 3001)

**Example Nginx Configuration Update:**
```nginx
# OLD: Redirect to core admin
# location /admin {
#     proxy_pass http://nova-core:3000;
# }

# NEW: Redirect to unified app
location /admin {
    proxy_pass http://nova-unified:3001;
}

# Redirect legacy admin URLs
location /nova-core {
    return 301 /admin$request_uri;
}
```

#### 2.2 Update Documentation URLs
- Update any documentation or bookmarks pointing to legacy admin interface
- Update deployment guides to remove core application references

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Optimization

#### 3.1 Remove Unused Docker Images
```bash
# Remove core application Docker images
docker rmi nova-universe/core:latest
docker image prune -f
```

#### 3.2 Clean Build Artifacts
```bash
# Remove core application build artifacts
rm -rf apps/core/nova-core/dist
rm -rf apps/core/nova-core/node_modules
rm -rf apps/core/nova-core/.next
```

#### 3.3 Update Package Dependencies
```bash
# Review and remove any core-specific dependencies from root package.json
# Keep only database-related scripts like prisma:generate:core
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Preservations

### MUST NOT REMOVE:
1. **Database**: Core database must remain (unified app uses same data)
2. **Environment Variables**: All `CORE_DB_*` and `CORE_DATABASE_URL` variables
3. **Prisma Schema**: `prisma/core/schema.prisma` (data access layer)
4. **Database Migration Files**: Any core database migrations

### Data Migration Notes:
- **No data migration required** - unified app accesses same database
- **User accounts preserved** - authentication system unchanged
- **Historical data intact** - tickets, assets, configurations maintained

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Pre-Cleanup Tests ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Unified application starts successfully
- [x] All admin pages accessible
- [x] Navigation functional
- [x] No import dependencies on core

### Post-Cleanup Validation Checklist
- [ ] Unified application still starts after core removal
- [ ] Database connectivity maintained
- [ ] All admin functions working
- [ ] User authentication successful
- [ ] No broken links or 404 errors
- [ ] Production deployment successful

---

## üö® Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise:
1. **Restore Core Application**:
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   mv backups/legacy-applications/[date]/nova-core-legacy apps/core
   
   # Re-enable in docker-compose.prod.yml
   # Uncomment nova-core service block
   
   # Restart services
   docker-compose up -d nova-core
   ```

2. **Restore Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Add back CORE_URL to environment
   export CORE_URL=https://admin.your-domain.com
   ```

3. **Revert Proxy Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Restore original nginx/proxy rules
   # Point /admin back to core application
   ```

## üìä Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Core application container removed from production
- [ ] Legacy admin URLs redirect to unified interface  
- [ ] All admin functionality accessible via unified app
- [ ] Zero downtime during cleanup process
- [ ] Database connectivity and data integrity maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture

### Performance Improvements Expected:
- **Reduced Infrastructure**: One less application container
- **Simplified Deployment**: Single admin interface to maintain
- **Better User Experience**: Consistent Apple-inspired design
- **Enhanced Security**: Modern React 19 implementation with latest security practices
