# Nova Universe API Security Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Nova Universe API to address identified vulnerabilities and enhance overall security posture.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded JWT Secret ❌ FIXED

**Issue**: Test file contained hardcoded JWT secret
**Location**: `apps/api/generate-test-token.js`
**Fix**: Updated to use environment variable with secure fallback validation
**Impact**: Prevents exposure of production secrets in test code

### 2. Missing Import Statement ❌ FIXED

**Issue**: Missing jwt import in auth middleware
**Location**: `apps/api/middleware/auth.js`
**Fix**: Added proper import statement for jsonwebtoken
**Impact**: Prevents runtime errors in JWT token generation

### 3. Enhanced JWT Secret Validation ✅ IMPROVED

**Issue**: Insufficient validation of JWT secret strength
**Location**: `apps/api/jwt.js`
**Improvements**:

- Minimum 32 character length requirement
- Detection of common weak secrets
- Consistent validation in both sign and verify functions

### 4. API Key Brute Force Protection ✅ IMPROVED

**Issue**: No protection against API key brute force attacks
**Location**: `apps/api/middleware/security.js`
**Improvements**:

- Added 1-second delay for failed API key attempts
- Enhanced logging with user agent and URL information
- Better rate limiting for invalid key attempts

### 5. Password Strength Validation ✅ IMPROVED

**Issue**: Weak password validation
**Location**: `apps/api/middleware/validation.js`
**Improvements**:

- Added maximum password length (128 chars)
- Detection of common weak passwords
- Better error codes for different validation failures
- Prevention of dictionary attacks

### 6. Error Information Leakage ✅ IMPROVED

**Issue**: JWT verification errors exposed sensitive information
**Location**: `apps/api/jwt.js`
**Fix**: Removed error logging that could expose internal details

## Security Headers and Middleware

### Helmet Configuration ✅ VERIFIED

- Content Security Policy (CSP) properly configured
- Cross-Origin policies set appropriately
- Security headers for XSS protection, MIME sniffing prevention
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled

### CORS Configuration ✅ VERIFIED

- Origin validation with whitelist approach
- Credentials handling properly configured
- Development vs production origin handling

### Input Sanitization ✅ VERIFIED

- Recursive object sanitization
- XSS vector removal
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation ✅ VERIFIED

- Proper token structure with issuer and audience validation
- Secure expiration times (1-12 hours)
- Environment-based secret management

### Role-Based Access Control ✅ VERIFIED

- Role and permission validation middleware
- Proper user context attachment
- Access logging for security monitoring

### Rate Limiting ✅ VERIFIED

- Per-user and IP-based rate limiting
- Different limits for different endpoints
- Redis-backed for distributed applications

## Database Security

### Query Protection ✅ VERIFIED

- Parameterized queries throughout the application
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Database connection security

### Configuration Management ✅ VERIFIED

- Environment variable validation
- Secure defaults for development
- Production configuration requirements

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Event Logging ✅ VERIFIED

- Failed authentication attempts
- API key validation failures
- Rate limit violations
- Request/response logging with security context

### Error Handling ✅ VERIFIED

- Production vs development error responses
- Structured error types and codes
- Proper error context collection

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### 1. API Key Management

- Implement API key rotation mechanism
- Add API key scoping and permissions
- Monitor API key usage patterns

### 2. Session Management

- Implement secure session storage
- Add session invalidation mechanisms
- Monitor concurrent sessions

### 3. Database Security

- Regular security audits of queries
- Database encryption at rest
- Database access logging

### 4. Monitoring Enhancements

- Real-time security alerting
- Automated threat detection
- Security metrics dashboard

### 5. Compliance

- Regular security penetration testing
- OWASP compliance verification
- Security documentation updates

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Security Variables

```bash
# Required for secure operation
JWT_SECRET=<64-character-random-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<64-character-random-string>
SCIM_TOKEN=<secure-random-token>
KIOSK_TOKEN=<secure-random-token>

# Database security
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-database-password>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-character-encryption-key>

# SMTP security (if used)
SMTP_PASS=<secure-smtp-password>

# API security
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
```

### Security Validation Script

A validation script has been improved to check for:

- Required environment variables
- Secret strength validation
- Configuration security review

## Testing Security

### Security Tests Added

- JWT secret validation tests
- Password strength validation tests
- API key format validation tests
- CORS configuration tests

### Manual Security Testing

Regular testing should include:

- Authentication bypass attempts
- SQL injection testing
- XSS payload testing
- Rate limiting verification
- Error message analysis
