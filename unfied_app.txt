## Analysis: Should Orbit, Core, and Pulse be Combined?

**Recommendation: YES** - They should be consolidated into a single, modular application.

### Industry Standards Analysis

Based on current ITSM industry trends (ServiceNow, Freshservice, etc.), the modern approach favors:

1. **Unified Interface**: Single app with role-based views rather than separate applications
2. **Modular Monolith**: Internal modularity with external unity
3. **Apple-Inspired Design**: Seamless, consistent experience across all functions
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works across all devices

### Current State vs. Recommended State

**Current State**:
- **Orbit**: End-user portal (React/Next.js)
- **Core**: Admin portal (React)
- **Pulse**: Technician portal (React/Vite)
- All use shared Nova Helix auth and Nova Core API

**Recommended State**:
- Single unified Nova Universe app with role-based interface switching
- Maintains PWA capabilities for mobile technicians
- Apple-inspired design system throughout
- Rewrite the app from scratch - use industry standards. Call it "novaUniverse-app"
- Ensure full CLI, Script and Documentation Compatibility.
