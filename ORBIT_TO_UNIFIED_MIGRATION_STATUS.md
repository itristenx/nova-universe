## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISKS & MITIGATION**

### High Priority Risks
1. **User Experience Degradation**: International users lose localized experience
   - *Mitigation*: Complete i18n migration before any deprecation
   
2. **Mobile User Abandonment**: Loss of PWA features affects mobile adoption
   - *Mitigation*: Implement PWA features first, test extensively
   
3. **Accessibility Compliance Violations**: Legal and user experience risks
   - *Mitigation*: Accessibility-first development, comprehensive testing

### Technical Risks
1. **Service Worker Complexity**: PWA implementation complexity
   - *Mitigation*: Incremental implementation, thorough testing
   
2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: PWA features vary by browser
   - *Mitigation*: Feature detection, graceful fallbacks

## üìÖ **RECOMMENDED TIMELINE**

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 weeks | i18n complete, PWA implemented, Accessibility enhanced |
| Phase 2 | 1-2 weeks | Mobile optimized, Kiosk integrated, Knowledge enhanced |
| Phase 3 | 1 week | Testing complete, Migration validated |

**Total Estimated Duration: 4-6 weeks**

## üö´ **DEPRECATION READINESS: NOT READY**

**RECOMMENDATION**: Do NOT deprecate Nova Orbit until all Phase 1 and Phase 2 features are complete and Phase 3 validation is successful.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete internationalization migration (highest priority)
2. Implement PWA features
3. Enhance accessibility compliance
4. Conduct comprehensive testing
5. Plan gradual user migration strategy
