## Risk Assessment

### **HIGH RISK - Deprecation Without Migration**
- **User Impact**: International users lose access to localized experience
- **Functionality Loss**: PWA features unavailable, reduced mobile experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance violations for disabled users
- **Business Risk**: Potential user abandonment and compliance issues

### **MITIGATION STRATEGY**
1. **Complete feature migration before deprecation**
2. **Gradual rollout with feature flags**
3. **Comprehensive testing across all user scenarios**
4. **Fallback mechanisms for critical features**

---

## Next Steps

### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

1. **❌ DO NOT DEPRECATE ORBIT YET**
2. **Implement missing critical features in Unified UI**
3. **Create feature migration plan with timelines**
4. **Set up parallel testing environment**
5. **Plan gradual user migration strategy**

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] 100% feature parity confirmed
- [ ] All languages and locales supported
- [ ] PWA features fully functional
- [ ] Accessibility compliance maintained
- [ ] Mobile experience equivalent or better
- [ ] Zero critical functionality loss

---

## Conclusion

**Nova Orbit CANNOT be safely deprecated at this time.** Critical features including internationalization, PWA capabilities, offline functionality, and enhanced accessibility are missing from the Unified UI. 

**Estimated time to achieve deprecation readiness: 4-6 weeks** with dedicated development resources.

**Recommendation:** Complete the feature migration plan outlined above before proceeding with any deprecation activities.
