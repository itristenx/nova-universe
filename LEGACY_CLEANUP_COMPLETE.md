## 🚀 Cleanup Actions EXECUTED

### ✅ Infrastructure Updates Completed

#### 1. Docker Compose Production Configuration
**File**: `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- ✅ **nova-core service**: Commented out and deprecated
- ✅ **nova-unified service**: Added with proper configuration
- ✅ **Port mapping**: Maintained 3001 for admin interface (now points to unified)
- ✅ **Environment variables**: Updated for Vite-based unified application

#### 2. Nginx Load Balancer Configuration  
**File**: `nginx/nginx.conf`
- ✅ **nova_core upstream**: Commented out and deprecated
- ✅ **nova_unified upstream**: Added pointing to unified application
- ✅ **Admin location block**: Updated to proxy to nova_unified
- ✅ **Headers preserved**: All security and proxy headers maintained

#### 3. Production Dockerfile Created
**File**: `apps/unified/Dockerfile.prod`
- ✅ **Multi-stage build**: Optimized for production deployment
- ✅ **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- ✅ **Health checks**: Proper container health monitoring
- ✅ **Port 3000**: Consistent with other services

### ✅ Database & Environment Preservation
- ✅ **CORE_DATABASE_URL**: Preserved (unified app uses same database)
- ✅ **Database schemas**: Preserved (prisma/core/schema.prisma)
- ✅ **User data**: Intact (no migration needed)
- ✅ **Historical data**: Preserved (tickets, assets, configurations)

---

## 🎯 Production Deployment Ready

### Next Steps for Production Deployment:
1. **Build unified application**: `docker build -f apps/unified/Dockerfile.prod -t nova-universe/unified:latest apps/unified`
2. **Deploy updated stack**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
3. **Verify admin access**: Test admin interface at configured domain/admin
4. **Monitor health checks**: Ensure unified application health checks pass

### Legacy Cleanup Opportunities:
- **Archive core code**: Move `apps/core/` to `backups/legacy-applications/`
- **Remove core images**: `docker rmi nova-universe/core:latest` 
- **Clean environment**: Remove `CORE_URL` from production environment
- **Update documentation**: Point admin documentation to unified interface
