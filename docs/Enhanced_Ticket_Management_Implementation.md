## Integration Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

The components use minimal external dependencies to ensure compatibility:

```bash
cd apps/pulse/nova-pulse
npm install @tanstack/react-query lucide-react
```

### 2. Update Main Routing

Replace the existing routing to use enhanced components:

```typescript
// In apps/pulse/nova-pulse/src/App.tsx or your main router
import { EnhancedTicketGrid } from './components/enhanced/EnhancedTicketGrid';
import { EnhancedDeepWorkPage } from './components/enhanced/EnhancedDeepWorkPage';
import { EnhancedDashboard } from './components/enhanced/EnhancedDashboard';

// Update routes
<Route path="/tickets" element={<EnhancedTicketGrid />} />
<Route path="/deep-work" element={<EnhancedDeepWorkPage />} />
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<EnhancedDashboard user={currentUser} />} />
```

### 3. API Integration

The components expect these API endpoints to be available:

```typescript
// Required API Endpoints
GET /api/tickets - List tickets with filtering and pagination
GET /api/tickets/:id - Get specific ticket details
PUT /api/tickets/:id - Update ticket
GET /api/queues - List available queues
GET /api/queue-metrics - Real-time queue performance data
GET /api/agent-performance - Agent productivity metrics
GET /api/knowledge-base - Knowledge base articles
POST /api/ai/suggestions - AI-powered suggestions
```

### 4. Database Schema

Ensure your database includes these tables (already defined in the Nova Universe schema):

```sql
-- Core tables
tickets, users, queues, queue_metrics, ticket_logs
-- Performance tracking
agent_performance, sla_definitions
-- Knowledge management
knowledge_articles, ticket_attachments
-- AI features
ai_suggestions, sentiment_analysis
```

### 5. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for full functionality:

```env
# AI Integration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
AI_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED=true

# Performance Monitoring
METRICS_COLLECTION_ENABLED=true
REAL_TIME_UPDATES_ENABLED=true

# Feature Flags
ENHANCED_UI_ENABLED=true
FOCUS_MODE_ENABLED=true
BULK_OPERATIONS_ENABLED=true
```
