# Nova Universe Monorepo Cleanup Plan (Step 1)

## Remove the following files/folders:

- All `package-lock.json` files in subfolders (use only `pnpm-lock.yaml` at root)
- Duplicate `.env.example` files in subfolders (`apps/comms/nova-comms/`, `apps/core/nova-core/`, `tools/scripts/scripts/`), keep only root
- Duplicate or unnecessary `migrate-database.js` in `prisma/` (keep only root or move to `tools/` if shared)
- Empty folders: `uploads/`, `tools/ci/`, all empty `backups/*` subfolders
- Any other lock files or build artifacts in `packages/*/dist/` and `log.sqlite` in root or packages
- Any other duplicate or outdated `README.md` files that are not specific to a package/app

## To Consolidate (next step):

- Documentation in `docs/`, `architecture/`, and `docs/project_docs/` should be reviewed and organized, but not deleted yet
- Config files in `tools/config/` should be the canonical source for ESLint, Jest, TypeScript, etc.
