# Phase 2: System Architecture & Technical Design

## Objective
Design a modern, scalable architecture for the Nova-Universe Platform rebuild, covering backend, frontend, and infrastructure. Ensure feature parity with the legacy system while implementing improvements in scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Deliverables
1. **Architecture Design Document**: Comprehensive documentation of the system's architecture.
2. **API Specification**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints.
3. **Security & Compliance Plan**: Detailed security measures and compliance strategies.
4. **Infrastructure & Deployment Diagram**: Visual representation of the deployment topology.
5. **Data Migration Plan**: Steps to migrate data from the legacy system to the new architecture.

## Tasks

### 1. Finalize Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js (v20 LTS) with Express.js, TypeScript.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for audit logs.
- **Frontend**: React (v18+) with TypeScript, Vite for build.
- **Mobile**: Swift/SwiftUI for iPad kiosk app.
- **Queue/Event Layer**: Redis for async tasks.
- **Authentication**: JWT, SCIM tokens, API keys.

### 2. Modular Architecture Design
- Define modules: API backend, Admin Web UI, Kiosk App, Slack Service.
- Create an architecture diagram showing module interactions.
- Plan for a monorepo structure with independent deployable services.

### 3. Database Schema & Data Model Design
- Design ER diagrams for tickets, users, roles, and metadata.
- Plan data migration scripts from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
- Include audit logging requirements.

### 4. API Specification
- Draft OpenAPI documentation for endpoints:
  - `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`
  - `/tickets` (CRUD operations)
  - `/users` (CRUD operations)
  - `/kiosks/activate`
- Define request/response schemas, authentication, and error codes.

### 5. Security & Compliance Design
- Implement RBAC with roles like admin, technician, end-user.
- Plan for SAML SSO integration.
- Define rate limiting, input validation, and encryption strategies.

### 6. Scalability & Infrastructure Design
- Plan containerized deployment with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Define load balancing and caching strategies.
- Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Finalize tech stack, modular design, and database schema.
- **Week 2**: Complete API specification and security plan.
- **Week 3**: Review and approve architecture design.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Over-engineering the architecture.
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on feature parity and iterative improvements.
- **Risk**: Missing legacy features.
  - **Mitigation**: Use the parity matrix as a checklist.
- **Risk**: Integration challenges with third-party systems.
  - **Mitigation**: Validate APIs early and create proof-of-concept tests.

## Approval
- **Reviewers**: Tech Lead, Security Architect, Product Manager.
- **Sign-off**: CTO or project sponsor.
