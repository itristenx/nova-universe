# Nova Universe Pre-Production Tasks - Final Completion

## âœ… COMPLETED REMAINING TASKS

### 1. Kiosk Configuration Reorganization - COMPLETED

**Issue**: Kiosk settings included device-level configurations that should be handled via MDM
**Solution**:

- Removed display timeout and sound effect settings (now handled via MDM)
- Reorganized kiosk configuration into logical sections:
  - **Messages**: Welcome message, help message, status message
  - **Open/Closed Status**: Per-device status management with radio button selection
  - **Branding & Assets**: Logo URL and background image URL configuration
- Added informational note about MDM handling device-level settings
- Updated button text from "Save Advanced Settings" to "Save Kiosk Configuration"

### 3. Analytics Page Enhancement - COMPLETED

**Issue**: Generic placeholder text that was too vague
**Solution**:

- Added detailed list of analytics capabilities:
  - Ticket analytics (response times, resolution patterns, volume trends)
  - Kiosk performance (usage metrics, uptime monitoring, user interactions)
  - System insights (performance metrics, integration status, operational reports)
