# Non-Functional Requirements Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the non-functional requirements for the Nova-Universe platform, including performance, scalability, security, and compliance needs.

---

## Performance Requirements

- **API Response Time**: All API endpoints must respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Concurrent Users**: Support at least 1,000 concurrent users.
- **Ticket Volume**: Handle up to 10,000 active tickets without performance degradation.
- **Database Queries**: Optimize queries to execute within 50ms on average.

---

## Scalability Requirements

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design API servers to scale horizontally without state dependencies.
- **Database Scalability**: Use PostgreSQL with replication and indexing for high performance.
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for frequently accessed data.
- **Load Balancing**: Use Nginx or cloud-based load balancers to distribute traffic.

---

## Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: Use SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, and JWT for secure access.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limits to prevent abuse (e.g., 5 login attempts per minute).
- **Audit Logging**: Log all critical actions with user, IP, and timestamp metadata.
- **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR and OWASP Top 10 compliance.

---

## Availability Requirements

- **Uptime**: Ensure 99.9% uptime for production environments.
- **Failover**: Implement failover mechanisms for critical services.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.

---

## Maintainability Requirements

- **Code Quality**: Enforce linting and code reviews for all changes.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API and developer documentation.
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
