# 🌟 NOVA VIP SYSTEM SPECIFICATION

## 🎯 Objective

Implement a robust, enterprise-ready VIP designation system across all Nova Universe modules to ensure specific users or groups receive **priority handling**, **custom SLAs**, **enhanced notifications**, and **queue elevation**.

---

## 🔐 VIP Entity Types

VIP status can be assigned based on:

- **User ID** (e.g., `user_id = exec-124`)
- **Group / Department** (e.g., "Broadcast Ops", "C-Suite")
- **Location** (e.g., HQ 11th Floor)
- **SCIM / Identity Provider Attributes**
  - `title = VP`
  - `isVIP = true`
  - `vip_level = gold|exec|priority`

### 🔄 Assignment Methods

- ✅ **Manual assignment** via Nova Core Admin UI  
- ✅ **Automated via SCIM / Okta rules**  
- ✅ **Programmatic API assignment**  
- ✅ **Cosmo/AI-initiated tagging based on logic**

---

## 🧭 VIP Behaviors & Features

### 🔺 1. Queue Priority Boost

- VIP tickets are **elevated to top of queues**
- Clearly marked with a **VIP badge/tag**
- Overrides normal FIFO or urgency sorting in Nova Pulse

### ⏱ 2. Custom SLA Policies

- VIPs follow **custom SLA thresholds**
  - Response SLA: _5 minutes_
  - Resolution SLA: _1 hour_
- SLAs tracked separately for reporting and alerting
- Missed SLA alerts are **escalated more aggressively**

### 📣 3. Enhanced Visibility & Notifications

- Push notifications sent for:
  - New VIP ticket created
  - SLA breach warning
- Custom Slack channels can receive pings (e.g., `#vip-alerts`)
- Tickets shown with gold border or unique color in UI

### 🤖 4. Cosmo Integration

- Cosmo auto-detects VIP status and adjusts:
  - Ticket tagging
  - Notifications
  - Priority boosts
- Warns of SLA risk
- Escalates across modules intelligently

### 🧾 5. Audit & History

- All VIP-related actions are logged:
  - When tag was added or removed
  - Which SLA policy was used
  - Time to respond / resolve
- Delegation activity also logged (e.g., ticket submitted by assistant)
