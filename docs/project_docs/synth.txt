Here’s a complete breakdown of the Nova Synth API layer and Cosmo, covering how Synth works within the Nova Universe, its architecture, endpoints, AI behaviors, and how Cosmo (the user-facing assistant) integrates with it.

Nova Synth API Layer & Cosmo Specification

1. Overview

Nova Synth is the AI orchestration engine for the Nova Universe. It provides:
	•	AI API layer for all modules (Pulse, Orbit, Core, Helix, Deck, Lore, Comms, Beacon).
	•	Cosmo, the branded user-facing assistant, built on top of Synth.
	•	Multi-model orchestration (LLMs, classification models, workflow engines).
	•	Secure API, integrated with Nova Helix (identity) for RBAC, auditing, and SCIM provisioning.
	•	Event-driven automation for tickets, knowledge base, workflows, and gamification.

Cosmo is simply the “persona and front-end experience” for Synth. Synth is the engine.

[Client/UI] → [Nova API Gateway] → [Nova Synth Service] → [AI Orchestration + Model Router]  
                                            ↓
                                      [Nova Core API]

Here’s a detailed breakdown of MCP (Model Context Protocol) support in Nova Synth, fully integrated with the API layer and Cosmo:

⸻

Nova Synth MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

1. Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for connecting LLMs to external tools, APIs, and data sources. In Nova, MCP is built into Synth to give Cosmo and other Nova modules secure, pluggable, and auditable AI tool access.

Purpose	Benefit in Nova
Standardized AI tool calling	Models interact with APIs via a single, consistent interface
Context sharing	MCP sessions share context across modules (Pulse, Orbit, Core, etc.)
Tenant isolation	Each tenant gets sandboxed MCP sessions
Pluggable tools	Admins can add or remove MCP endpoints (e.g., Slack, M365)
Compliance & audit logging	Every MCP request is tracked in Nova Core


⸻

2. Architecture

[Cosmo UI] → [Nova Synth API] → [MCP Runtime] → [Registered Tools (Nova + External)]

Key Components:
	1.	MCP Runtime (in Synth)
	•	Handles MCP session lifecycle.
	•	Maps MCP tools to Nova API endpoints or external APIs.
	•	Enforces Helix RBAC and tenant isolation.
	2.	Tool Registry
	•	Each tool is registered in Nova Core.
	•	Tools can be:
	•	Native Nova Tools (ticket actions, knowledge search, gamification)
	•	External Tools (Slack admin API, GoAlert proxy, M365 Graph)
	•	Custom Tools (per-tenant integrations)
	3.	Context Engine
	•	Injects contextual metadata into each MCP session:
	•	User info (from Helix)
	•	Tenant config (from Core)
	•	Conversation history
	•	Relevant ticket or KB context

⸻

3. MCP Workflow in Nova
	1.	User interacts with Cosmo (e.g., “Create a high-priority Ops ticket for package delivery”).
	2.	Cosmo → Synth API /v2/synth/conversation/:id/send.
	3.	Synth classifies intent and spawns an MCP session.
	4.	MCP runtime calls:
	•	nova.tickets.create (Nova internal tool)
	•	nova.gamification.xp (XP reward)
	5.	MCP session logs actions in Core → Cosmo responds with result.

⸻

4. MCP Session Structure

An MCP session is scoped to:
	•	User (Helix ID)
	•	Tenant
	•	Conversation
	•	Allowed tools (determined by RBAC and tenant config)

{
  "session_id": "mcp_12345",
  "user_id": "helix:usr_abc",
  "tenant_id": "tnt_xyz",
  "tools": ["nova.tickets", "nova.lore", "m365.graph", "goalalert.proxy"],
  "context": {
    "active_ticket": "INC-12345",
    "recent_xp": 50
  }
}


⸻

5. MCP Tools in Nova

Tool	Description	Example MCP Call
nova.tickets	Create, update, or link tickets	tickets.create({type:"INC"})
nova.lore	Query knowledge base	lore.search({query:"VPN issue"})
nova.gamification	Grant XP, badges	gamification.grantXP({amount:10})
nova.workflows	Trigger predefined workflows	workflows.execute({id:"wf-ops"})
m365.graph	Send/receive email, calendar events	m365.mail.send({...})
goalalert.proxy	Trigger alert escalation	goalalert.trigger({team:"Ops"})

Admins can add custom tools per tenant via Core’s MCP registry.

⸻

6. Security & Compliance
	•	RBAC: Helix enforces per-tool and per-action permissions.
	•	Session Isolation: Tools are scoped per MCP session, no cross-tenant access.
	•	Audit Logging: Each MCP call is logged in Core (who, what, when, result).
	•	Model Sandbox: Models cannot call APIs directly; they request MCP calls via Synth, which validates and executes them.

⸻

7. Cosmo + MCP

Cosmo automatically uses MCP under the hood:
	•	In Pulse: Cosmo can trigger MCP tools like nova.tickets.linkCI.
	•	In Orbit: Cosmo uses MCP for KB searches and request fulfillment.
	•	In Comms (Slack): Cosmo MCP sessions run in ephemeral Slack threads for security.
	•	In Beacon: MCP enables kiosk flows (e.g., “Report broken kiosk”).

⸻

8. MCP API Endpoints

Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/v2/synth/mcp/session	Start an MCP session
POST	/v2/synth/mcp/tool/:name	Execute MCP tool action
GET	/v2/synth/mcp/session/:id	Retrieve MCP session context
DELETE	/v2/synth/mcp/session/:id	End MCP session


⸻

9. Example: Cosmo Using MCP

sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Cosmo
  participant Synth
  participant MCP
  participant NovaTickets

  User->>Cosmo: "Create a high priority HR ticket"
  Cosmo->>Synth: classifyIntent()
  Synth->>MCP: startSession()
  MCP->>NovaTickets: tickets.create({type:"HR", priority:"High"})
  NovaTickets->>MCP: success
  MCP->>Synth: response
  Synth->>Cosmo: "Ticket HR-123 created!"
  Cosmo->>User: "Done! 🚀"


⸻

10. Enhancements
	•	Create a MCP server that allows Nova to connect to other AI tools. This should allow users to login via OAUTH matching the OpenAI standard.
