# Nova Pulse - Module Specification & Implementation Guide

## 🌌 Overview

**Nova Pulse** is the unified technician and agent module within the Nova Universe. It serves as the operational command center for handling all types of service tickets, alerts, asset management, HR/IT/Ops/Cyber queues, and technician workflows. It is deeply integrated with Nova Core (platform services), Nova Helix (identity/RBAC), Nova Mailroom (email engine), GoAlert (on-call alerting), and Cosmo (AI agent).

## 🎯 Purpose

- Centralized technician workspace
- Unified ticket handling across departments
- On-call alerting and deep work views
- Integrated asset management
- Role-based access to queues and modules
- Gamified experience with XP, achievements, and leaderboards

⸻

🧪 QA Scenarios
	•	Agent cannot view unauthorized queues
	•	Deep Work view only shows relevant metadata
	•	SLA pause resumes correctly after Cosmo suggestion
	•	Alerts cannot be created without a Pulse-based workflow
	•	XP awarded correctly per action type
	•	Inventory sync updates reflect in Pulse view

⸻

🧠 Developer Notes
	•	All API calls must pass through Nova Core proxy to ensure observability and auth enforcement
	•	Use feature flags (pulse.inventory.enabled, pulse.alerts.enabled) to toggle access per tenant
	•	LocalStorage can cache queue preferences
	•	Logs for all agent actions stored in Elastic and linked to Nova Audit Trail

⸻

🔄 Future Enhancements
	•	Inline KB feedback + edit from Pulse
	•	Alert correlation & AI signal triage
	•	Calendar-based queue scheduling
	•	Nova Synth “work whisperer” to route agents to next best ticket
	•	Scheduled ticket queues (repeating/seasonal ops tickets)
