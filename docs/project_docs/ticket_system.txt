Here is a full breakdown of the Nova Ticketing System‚Äîthe operational heart of the Nova Universe ITSM platform. This documentation details how tickets work, flows, ticket types, routing, lifecycle, tech stack, and key enterprise features, including Cosmo AI, RBAC, SLAs, and modular integrations.

‚∏ª

üõ∞Ô∏è Nova Ticketing System Overview

Nova‚Äôs ticketing system is the central engine that powers IT, HR, Cybersecurity, Operations, and general service workflows. It is modular, multi-channel, AI-enhanced, SLA-governed, and fully auditable. Tickets are unified across all modules but routed based on type, source, metadata, and role-based access control.

‚∏ª

üìå Ticket Entry Points

Channel	Description
Nova Orbit	End-user web portal
Nova Comms	Slack integration (/it-help, /hr-help, etc.)
Nova Beacon	iOS kiosk interface
Email	Ingested via Nova Mailroom
API	External systems or devices (via Nova Core APIs)
Cosmo AI	Smart triage and submission via chat or conversational UI


‚∏ª

üóÇÔ∏è Ticket Types (Unified and ITIL-Aligned)

Type	Description	Default Routing To
INC	Incident ‚Äî Unexpected disruption or degraded service	IT ‚Üí Pulse (IT Queue)
REQ	Request ‚Äî Services, hardware, onboarding, access, etc.	Catalog-driven routing
PRB	Problem ‚Äî Root cause analysis, often linked to multiple Incidents	Problem Management
CHG	Change ‚Äî Change management (hardware, software, access, infra)	Change Board
TASK	Task ‚Äî Child of other tickets; assigned to individuals or teams	Custom route
HR	HR ‚Äî Confidential HR issues or requests (leave, grievances)	Pulse (HR Queue)
OPS	Operations ‚Äî Facilities, equipment, logistics, etc.	Pulse (Ops Queue)
ISAC	Cybersecurity ‚Äî Security incident, alert, or review	Pulse (Cyber Queue)
FEEDBACK	Feedback ‚Äî User experience suggestions or comments	Feedback Pool
OTHER	Fallback type if not classified (will be triaged by Cosmo or manually reclassified)	Default Tier 1


‚∏ª

üîÑ Ticket Lifecycle Flow

For INC, REQ, HR, etc.
	1.	Submission ‚Üí via any channel
	2.	Classification ‚Üí Cosmo NLP or manual (assigns type, urgency, impact)
	3.	Routing ‚Üí Queue based on type, metadata, requestor org/role
	4.	Triage ‚Üí Technician reviews, assigns or responds
	5.	Work Execution ‚Üí Tasks assigned, comments, attachments added
	6.	Resolution ‚Üí Solution recorded, Cosmo KB suggested
	7.	Feedback ‚Üí Optional survey, feedback recorded
	8.	Closure ‚Üí SLA compliance checked, ticket locked for audit

‚∏ª

üß† Cosmo AI Involvement
	‚Ä¢	Auto-categorization of ticket types
	‚Ä¢	Smart suggestions for resolution (from Nova Lore KB)
	‚Ä¢	Impact/Urgency estimation using historical context
	‚Ä¢	Intent matching to catalog or routing rules
	‚Ä¢	Auto-fill forms with inferred data
	‚Ä¢	Loopbacks to Cosmo KB after resolution for article suggestions

‚∏ª

üß≠ Request Catalog Flow (REQ)
	1.	End user browses Request Catalog (Nova Orbit)
	2.	Form is dynamically rendered based on selection (form config stored in Nova Core)
	3.	Required fields (name, device, access level, etc.) validated
	4.	Workflow triggered (approvals, sub-tasks, automations)
	5.	SLA timer begins
	6.	Approval ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí Fulfillment ‚Üí Close

Catalog is scoped by role, org, and location using Nova Helix + RBAC.

‚∏ª

üß© Ticket Metadata

Each ticket supports:
	‚Ä¢	Type, Status, Priority, Impact, Urgency
	‚Ä¢	Submitter & Organization (via Helix)
	‚Ä¢	Assigned Technician or Team
	‚Ä¢	Flags: VIP, Security, Legal Hold, Audit Required
	‚Ä¢	Timestamps: Created, Updated, Resolved, SLA Breach
	‚Ä¢	Custom Fields: Defined per catalog item or ticket type

‚∏ª

‚è±Ô∏è SLA Engine

Feature	Description
SLA Policies	Defined per type or catalog item
SLA Matrix	Urgency √ó Impact ‚Üí Response/Resolve Targets
Breach Alerts	Trigger escalation, alerts, or auto-routing
SLA Exceptions & Overrides	Manual or policy-based
SLA Reporting	Tracked per queue, org, or tech


‚∏ª

üîê RBAC & Access Control

Role	Access
end_user	Can submit, view own tickets
tech	Can view/respond to tickets in assigned queues
tech_lead	Can assign tickets, modify queue SLAs, manage approvals
admin	Full access across queues + audit trail + config
hr_tech	Can only see HR tickets
cyber_tech	Can only see ISAC tickets
ops_tech	Can only see OPS tickets

These are assigned via SCIM + Helix, and refined via Pulse submodule permissions.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Automation & Workflows
	‚Ä¢	Triggers: New ticket, status change, SLA breach
	‚Ä¢	Actions: Email, webhook, reassign, escalate, Slack notify
	‚Ä¢	Approval Flows: Multi-step with fallback and SLA
	‚Ä¢	Auto-assignment: Based on skillset, tags, org
