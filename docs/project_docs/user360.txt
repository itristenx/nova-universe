# Nova User 360 – Full Specification

## 1. Overview

**Nova User 360** is the **single source of truth** for all user-related data across the **Nova Universe**.
It consolidates identity, activity, asset, ticket, security, and productivity data into a **unified technician view**, enabling fast, contextual decision-making.

**Primary Goals**

* Centralize **all relevant user data** in a **real-time, single pane of glass**.
* Enrich user profiles automatically via integrations with internal/external systems.
* Support **role-based access** (RBAC) and **tenant-scoped views**.
* Serve as the **data backbone** for Nova Pulse, Nova Orbit, Cosmo AI, and reporting.
