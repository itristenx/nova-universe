Yes—**Nova Helix and User360 should be tightly integrated** but remain **separate components** with clear responsibilities.

Helix is the **identity and access engine** (authentication, roles, SCIM, credential vault), while User360 is a **context and intelligence layer** for technicians. Their integration ensures a unified, secure, and automated user view across the Nova Universe.

## Why They Should Be Integrated

| Area                   | Reason                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Linking**   | Helix is the single source of truth for identity (Nova ID). User360 depends on this to correctly map users, assets, tickets, and integrations. |
| **SSO & MFA**          | Helix handles login, MFA enforcement, and token issuance. User360 should not duplicate this logic.                                             |
| **RBAC Enforcement**   | User360’s visibility (HR data, security info, assets) is entirely role-driven. Helix is the role provider.                                     |
| **Audit Trail**        | Actions taken in User360 (reset MFA, disable account, reassign asset) must be logged against the user’s Helix identity.                        |
| **Integration Access** | User360 queries NIL for enriched user context. Helix ensures only properly scoped service tokens are used.                                     |

## Recommended Integration Model

```
+-----------------------------+
|        Nova Helix           |
|  (Identity & Access Layer)  |
|-----------------------------|
| • SSO / MFA                |
| • SCIM Provisioning        |
| • Roles & Permissions      |
| • Credential Vault         |
| • Audit Trail              |
+--------------+--------------+
               |
               v
+--------------+--------------+
|         User360             |
| (User Context & Intelligence)|
|-----------------------------|
| • Unified Profile          |
| • Linked Assets (via CMDB) |
| • Linked Tickets           |
| • HR & Security Context    |
| • Technician Actions       |
+--------------+--------------+
               |
               v
+--------------+--------------+
|    Nova Integration Layer    |
| (NIL)                        |
|------------------------------|
| • Data Sync (Jamf, Intune)  |
| • HR, Security, IT Data     |
| • Normalization             |
| • Event Bus                 |
+--------------+--------------+
               |
               v
+--------------+--------------+
|          CMDB               |
| • Assets & Services         |
| • Relationships             |
| • Ownership (Helix IDs)     |

## Integration Principles

* **Helix is always the identity authority** — User360 never stores or modifies identity data outside of Helix.
* **User360 consumes Helix tokens** — all access is scoped based on Helix-issued role claims.
* **Helix drives contextual access** — for example, HR roles can see HR-related data in User360, but IT cannot unless granted specific access.
* **Cosmo AI uses Helix identities** — any automation or AI-driven action is traceable to a Helix identity for compliance.

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
Helix and User360 should remain separate but deeply connected.

* Helix = **Who a user is and what they can do.**
* User360 = **What context a technician or admin can see and act upon for that user.**
