Here is a complete breakdown of Database, API, and User Data Security designed to meet enterprise-grade, auditable, and scalable standards for platforms like Nova:

üîê Nova Platform Security Breakdown

Sections:
	‚Ä¢	1. Database Security
	‚Ä¢	2. API Security
	‚Ä¢	3. User Data Security & Compliance
	‚Ä¢	4. Logging, Auditing & Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	5. DevOps & Infra Security Considerations

‚∏ª

1. DATABASE SECURITY

Applies to SQL (PostgreSQL) + NoSQL (MongoDB) + ElasticSearch layers in Nova.

üî∏ 1.1. Isolation Strategy
	‚Ä¢	Separate Databases per Function:
	‚Ä¢	Core user/identity ‚Üí PostgreSQL (Helix)
	‚Ä¢	Ticketing/Records ‚Üí PostgreSQL
	‚Ä¢	Asset inventory ‚Üí PostgreSQL
	‚Ä¢	Logs/metadata/search ‚Üí ElasticSearch
	‚Ä¢	Realtime/cache state ‚Üí Redis
	‚Ä¢	Multi-Tenant Isolation:
	‚Ä¢	Logical separation using tenant_id in all records
	‚Ä¢	Optional physical DB separation for high-sensitivity orgs

üî∏ 1.2. Role-Based Access to DB
	‚Ä¢	Roles: app_readonly, app_rw, admin_rw, reporting, audit
	‚Ä¢	Use row-level security (RLS) for tenant & role control
	‚Ä¢	DB user accounts never reused across services

üî∏ 1.3. Encryption
	‚Ä¢	At Rest:
	‚Ä¢	Postgres with TDE or volume-level encryption (AES-256)
	‚Ä¢	MongoDB with WiredTiger Encryption
	‚Ä¢	ElasticSearch with encrypted indices
	‚Ä¢	In Transit:
	‚Ä¢	All DB connections via TLS 1.2+
	‚Ä¢	Enforce SSL in PostgreSQL (sslmode=require)
	‚Ä¢	Rotate DB TLS certificates every 3‚Äì6 months

üî∏ 1.4. Secrets Management
	‚Ä¢	Use Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Doppler
	‚Ä¢	Never commit secrets to code. All secrets loaded via env injection at runtime.

2. API SECURITY

Focus on securing the Nova v2 unified API layer, including internal/external endpoints.

üî∏ 2.1. Authentication
	‚Ä¢	End users: via Helix (Nova ID), supporting:
	‚Ä¢	SSO (SAML, OIDC)
	‚Ä¢	Local login
	‚Ä¢	Token-based auth (JWT)
	‚Ä¢	Apps/Services: via Scoped API Keys (Nova Core)
	‚Ä¢	Keys tied to role and tenant
	‚Ä¢	Can be revoked & rotated
	‚Ä¢	Optional IP or time constraints

üî∏ 2.2. Authorization
	‚Ä¢	Centralized RBAC engine
	‚Ä¢	Access control via scoped permissions
	‚Ä¢	Service-to-service calls use minimal-permission tokens
	‚Ä¢	Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
	‚Ä¢	Used for tickets, assets, and HR data
	‚Ä¢	Context-aware checks: department, queue, flag, etc.

üî∏ 2.3. Rate Limiting
	‚Ä¢	Enforced at CDN and API Gateway level (e.g. 429s)
	‚Ä¢	Role-based thresholds: end_user < agent < service
	‚Ä¢	Supports burst + sustained rate logic

üî∏ 2.4. Transport Security
	‚Ä¢	All APIs require HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)
	‚Ä¢	HSTS headers enforced
	‚Ä¢	Optional mutual TLS for service-to-service APIs

üî∏ 2.5. Input Validation & Threat Prevention
	‚Ä¢	Use schema validation (Zod, Joi) at every endpoint
	‚Ä¢	Sanitize input against XSS, SQLi, NoSQLi, prototype pollution
	‚Ä¢	Enforce Content-Security-Policy for frontend-originating requests

‚∏ª

3. USER DATA SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

Protecting PII, org data, and internal comms.

üî∏ 3.1. Data Classification
	‚Ä¢	User Data (PII): Full Name, Email, Org, IP, Usage
	‚Ä¢	Ticket Data: Comments, attachments, metadata
	‚Ä¢	System Data: Device info, logs, audit trails
	‚Ä¢	Each has a classification (e.g. Sensitive, Restricted, Public)

üî∏ 3.2. Encryption
	‚Ä¢	PII Fields: Encrypted at field-level (e.g. AES-GCM)
	‚Ä¢	Full Disk Encryption on infra & backup volumes
	‚Ä¢	Encrypted backups with daily rotation & immutable snapshots

üî∏ 3.3. Retention & Deletion
	‚Ä¢	Configurable retention rules by org
	‚Ä¢	Manual and automated deletion workflows
	‚Ä¢	Hard delete queue with audit trail

üî∏ 3.4. Data Access Controls
	‚Ä¢	No lateral access by default
	‚Ä¢	HR, Cyber, Ops data in separate logical partitions
	‚Ä¢	Admins cannot access tickets unless explicitly delegated
	‚Ä¢	All access logged with context (who, when, why)

üî∏ 3.5. Compliance Alignment
	‚Ä¢	GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA-aligned handling
	‚Ä¢	DSR (Data Subject Request) support built-in
	‚Ä¢	Optional data residency (US, EU, APAC) via tenant routing

‚∏ª

4. LOGGING, AUDITING & MONITORING

üî∏ 4.1. Logging
	‚Ä¢	Structured logs with request ID, user ID, tenant, module
	‚Ä¢	Centralized logging pipeline (Elastic / Loki / S3-based storage)

üî∏ 4.2. Audit Trails
	‚Ä¢	Immutable logs for all admin actions, role changes, ticket edits
	‚Ä¢	Viewable in Nova Core (RBAC-limited)

üî∏ 4.3. Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	API error/warning metrics via Prometheus/Grafana
	‚Ä¢	Alerts for rate limit violations, auth failures, DB spikes
	‚Ä¢	Tamper-evident log stream via checksum chains

‚∏ª

5. DEVOPS & INFRA SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

üî∏ 5.1. Zero Trust Access
	‚Ä¢	All services use mutual auth
	‚Ä¢	Developers access via VPN + MFA + role-gated bastion
	‚Ä¢	Infra is not reachable directly without tunnel/MFA

üî∏ 5.2. Secrets Hygiene
	‚Ä¢	All build pipelines use ephemeral credentials
	‚Ä¢	Secrets rotation policy: every 90 days minimum
	‚Ä¢	Secrets never printed in logs or errors

üî∏ 5.3. CI/CD Hardening
	‚Ä¢	Pull request scanning (code quality, secrets, security)
	‚Ä¢	Build artifact signing
	‚Ä¢	Promotion only from trusted branches

üî∏ 5.4. Container & Runtime Security
	‚Ä¢	Images scanned for CVEs via Trivy or Clair
	‚Ä¢	Only signed images are deployed
	‚Ä¢	Runtime sec with AppArmor or Seccomp + eBPF monitoring
